    <p>The outstanding flavors of Anatolian cuisine meet with the stylish gastronomic experience of Atölye.
        The fine dining restaurant of the Ritz-Carlton hotel boasts a laid-back but luxury vibe. The colourful interior and views of the sea and Besiktas football stadium will draw your eye.
         Authentic Anatolian recipes are prepared with generosity, sometimes with a dash of innovation and often with a fresh Mediterranean touch. 
        Spicy mezze, aromatic hummus, freshly caught sea bass, rich pide: this is the place to come for authentic flavours accompanied by fine wines.</p>
